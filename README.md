<h1>ImageViewer Application</h1>
<p>The Image Viewer application is a desktop application which automatically scales down large image, while maintaining the aspect ratio of image, to properly fit it(image) in viewing area of display window.
The Zoom in or out functionality takes special care of aspect ratio while scaling up or down image so that image detailing will not get lost. The Image processing is done using openCV to preserve detailing of image while resizing it.<br/></p>
